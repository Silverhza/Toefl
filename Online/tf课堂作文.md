There is no debate that reading news against our point of view is able to broaden our horizon. That is to say, reading news different from our viewpoint provides us with a new perspective which we have not noticed before.



There are good reasons to suggest that reading news with different standpoint is able to help us make more friends. Since everyone likes to be friends with people who are tolerant, if you can be a tolerant person, there is no doubt that you will have more friends. To be more specific, it is proved that the one who can accept different opinions with himself is a tolerant man.
