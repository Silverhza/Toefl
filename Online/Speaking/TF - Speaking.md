**重中之重**（核心价值）：你的选择

**重点**：理由+细节（topic development/example)

**结构**：对/错/1/2---理由

## 如何回答好独立口语题：

### 1.开门见山，直述答案

Personally speaking (from my point of view), I (totally) agree/disagree with this statement (千万不要重复这个句子) for following two reasons (with couple of reasons).

Personally speaking (from my point of view), I prefer the 1st/2nd opinion/attitude/option/view/choice (基于特定情况说一下自己的选择，看题目篇幅长短，短的话可以引用) for following two reasons (with couple of reasons).

PS: agree with the first group of people

### 2.提出理由，支持态度/选择

**1)** The first reason is... :

firstly/first of all/to begin with/one important reason is...

**2)** The second reason is... :

**同位并列关系**：meanwhile/moreover/what's more/in addition/at the same time

**递进关系**：furthermore/more importantly

**对比关系**：on the other hand/oppositely

**万金油**：another important reason is... 配合one important reason使用

### 3.做出总结，呼应观点：

That's the reason why I prefer...



**时间把控：**

7-8‘：开头

## 综合口语：

### 1.记笔记技巧

**针对阅读部分：一个身子两条腿**

一个身子：学校要做的事情或者有人建议要做的事情（85%-90%情况下，从文章标题就可找到）

两条腿：两个层面（原因：为什么要做这件事？影响：做这件事可能带来的直接影响/做这件事可能会有什么意外的收获）

**针对听力部分：两个身子两条腿**

两个身子（核心）：男/女 对/错

两条腿：针对于阅读中的两个层面进行一一对应（支持：补充说明/反对：怼）

### 2.回答技巧：

#### 针对于文字部分:先一句话概括要做的事情（或建议要做的事情）

In this announcement, the university decides to ...

In this letter, a person suggested that the university should ...

针对于对话同意阅读情况下 ：加上后面文章中提及的层面

E.g because the university wants to commuter students could enjoy the same advantage with the dorm students and there will be a board to share some important information 

针对于对话反对阅读情况下：后面什么都别加

（目的：针对同意情况下，起到锦上添花作用；而对于反对情况下，起到对应对比作用）

#### 针对于听力部分

(However,) In the conversation, the man/woman agrees/disagrees with this announcement/suggestion letter with couple of reasons. 

 (Support/against/holds postive/negative attitude to)

**1）第一点：First of all, ...(针对于同意情况，直接就说听力中细节内容)**

In the passage, the university announced/ the person suggested that ... while the man/woman believed that ...（针对于反对情况，做好对比）

**2）第二点：Meanwhile,...（操作方式同上）**

That's the reason why the man/woman agrees/disagrees with this announcement/suggestion letter.

Chaining behavior is a technique used by parents to teach children a sequence of complex behaviors. For example, professor taught his daughter how to wash her hands. He divided this complex behavior into 5 steps, and taught his daughter one step at a time. He first showed his daughter step 1 and practiced it with her for a couple of days. When she has mastered this action, he showed her step 2 and let her practice both steps for another few days until she can do both by herself. Then he added the third step after, and also let her practice for a while until she can do them all. For the last two steps, he did the same thing as the previous three steps. Finally she could finish the hand washing all by herself.
