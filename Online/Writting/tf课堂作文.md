In recent years, a large number of people read news in different ways every day. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that seeing news which is same as their points is more benificial. However, from my standpoint, I prefer to reading news which against my point of view with the following reasons.

First and foremost, there is no debate that reading news against our point of view is able to broaden our horizon. That is to say, reading news different from our viewpoint provides us with a new perspective which we have not noticed before. Take myself as an example. I still remember when I was in middle school, I liked watching newspaper very much. At that time, I believed that It was not necessary to protect the environment, since it had the ability to refresh itself. But one day I inadvertently saw a report on newspaper, it said the environmental pollution had exceeded the ability of the earth's self-purification. If humans did not take actions, our world would be in danger. This news shocked me and showed the urgency that I had not noticed before. Therefore, reading news different from our viewpoint could broaden our horizon.



Secondly, there are good reasons to suggest that reading news with different standpoint is able to help us make more friends. Since everyone likes to be friends with people who are tolerant, if you can be a tolerant person, there is no doubt that you will have more friends. To be more specific, it is proved that the one who can accept different opinions with himself is a tolerant man. We might take my friend John as an example. Because of excellent grades, John became the monitor of my class in middle school. However, when in the first semester, he was always lonely, and no one wanted to be friend with him. The problem is that he was irritabile. When others made mistakes, he would severely criticize them so he was not able to make friends. But surprisingly, in the second semester, he totally changed and became another person, gentle and easy going. Once someone made mistakes, he would tolerate it moderately. From then on, he gradually integrated into the class. One day I asked him what made him change so much. He told me that he started to read news against his point of view since the first semester which helped a lot. It made him see things in different standpoint and let him become be a tolerant person. Thus, reading news with different standpoint is able to help us make more friends.

In conclusion, reading news with different  point of view is better with respect to  expansion of knowledge horizon and the more chances to make friends.

Admittedly, some people may argue that teacher can not be both effective in teaching and liked by student. Since most students feel disgusted with excessive learning pressure, a teacher assigns too much homework  will definitely not be welcomed by students. However, they ignore the fact that there are a lot of approaches to solve this problem. First, telling students that teacher assigning so many homework is a manifestation of responsibility so that students can understand the teacher’s behavior. Second, despite of the great study pressure, teachers can reward outstanding students to encourage them so that they will not feel ddistressed to finish their academic burden. Therefore, being both effective and welcomed is not hard for teachers.

We often encounter some problems in daily life. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the  government when they meet problems. However, from my standpoint, I am more willing to rely on my own and family with the following reasons.

Firstly, there are good reasons to suggest that seeking family for help or relying on our own is more efficient than relying on the government. To be more specific, to get help form government, we always need to wait for days and follow a lot of processes. However, relying on ourselves and family avoid these long processes. For instance, two years ago, I wanted to apply for a small loan to start a business. I went to the relevant department and filled out a large number of documents, and then the staff asked me to go home and wait for the notice. However, I waited for a week without any news. Finally, I had to asked my family for help. They gave me a lot of money without any hesitation (saying a word). Therefore, seeking family for help or relying on our own is more efficient than counting on the government.

...Secondly,

Admittedly, some people may argue that ourselves or family are not professional in every field. Compared to the government, we do not have experts or specialized departments, so we can't handle everything. However, they ignore the fact that there are a lot of approaches to solve this problem. First, when encountering new problems we can search the internet for professional solutions. Second, if we are not familiar with one field, we can try to consult experts in our family or around us for help. Consequently,  I am more willing to rely on my own and family than the government.

In conclusion, seeking family for help or relying on our own is better than counting on the government with respect to efficiency and ... , though the government is more professional in some field.





In addition, the other two methods are less ideal to our health to learn new things. For one thing, cooking food which we seldom ate may lead to food allergy. For example, I never tried to eat crab before, and one day some of my friend told me to try. It truly tasted good, but I eat too much. After that, I stayed on bed for two days because of crab allergy. Therefore, cooking food we do not normally eat may make the body uncomfortable. For another, it will put weight if we choose crafts like knitting. Because when we are crafting something, we sometimes sit on the chair for whole day. Therefore, it can easily lead to obesity. I still remember that my grandmother used to knit a lot. She liked knitting very much, but she soon found out that her weight is increasing rapidly, because she always busied in knitting. Thus, crafts like knitting will put our weight. As a consequence, there are clearly limitations concerning the other two choices of learning new things.
