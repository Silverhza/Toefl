In recent years, a large number of people read news in different ways every day. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that seeing news which is same as their points is more benificial. However, from my standpoint, I prefer to reading news which against my point of view with the following reasons.

First and foremost, there is no debate that reading news against our point of view is able to broaden our horizon. That is to say, reading news different from our viewpoint provides us with a new perspective which we have not noticed before. Take myself as an example. I still remember when I was in middle school, I liked watching newspaper very much. At that time, I believed that It was not necessary to protect the environment, since it had the ability to refresh itself. But one day I inadvertently saw a report on newspaper, it said the environmental pollution had exceeded the ability of the earth's self-purification. If humans did not take actions, our world would be in danger. This news shocked me and showed the urgency that I had not noticed before. Therefore, reading news different from our viewpoint could broaden our horizon.



Secondly, there are good reasons to suggest that reading news with different standpoint is able to help us make more friends. Since everyone likes to be friends with people who are tolerant, if you can be a tolerant person, there is no doubt that you will have more friends. To be more specific, it is proved that the one who can accept different opinions with himself is a tolerant man. We might take my friend John as an example. Because of excellent grades, John became the monitor of my class in middle school. However, when in the first semester, he was always lonely, and no one wanted to be friend with him. The problem is that he was irritabile. When others made mistakes, he would severely criticize them so he was not able to make friends. But surprisingly, in the second semester, he totally changed and became another person, gentle and easy going. Once someone made mistakes, he would tolerate it moderately. From then on, he gradually integrated into the class. One day I asked him what made him change so much. He told me that he started to read news against his point of view since the first semester which helped a lot. It made him see things in different standpoint and let him become be a tolerant person. Thus, reading news with different standpoint is able to help us make more friends.

In conclusion, reading news with different  point of view is better with respect to  expansion of knowledge horizon and the more chances to make friends.

Admittedly, some people may argue that teacher can not be both effective in teaching and liked by student. Since most students feel disgusted with excessive learning pressure, a teacher assigns too much homework  will definitely not be welcomed by students. However, they ignore the fact that there are a lot of approaches to solve this problem. First, telling students that teacher assigning so many homework is a manifestation of responsibility so that students can understand the teacher’s behavior. Second, despite of the great study pressure, teachers can reward outstanding students to encourage them so that they will not feel ddistressed to finish their academic burden. Therefore, being both effective and welcomed is not hard for teachers.

We often encounter some problems in daily life. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the  government when they meet problems. However, from my standpoint, I am more willing to rely on my own and family with the following reasons.

Firstly, there are good reasons to suggest that seeking family for help or relying on our own is more efficient than relying on the government. To be more specific, to get help form government, we always need to wait for days and follow a lot of processes. However, relying on ourselves and family avoid these long processes. For instance, two years ago, I wanted to apply for a small loan to start a business. I went to the relevant department and filled out a large number of documents, and then the staff asked me to go home and wait for the notice. However, I waited for a week without any news. Finally, I had to asked my family for help. They gave me a lot of money without any hesitation (saying a word). Therefore, seeking family for help or relying on our own is more efficient than counting on the government.

...Secondly,

Admittedly, some people may argue that ourselves or family are not professional in every field. Compared to the government, we do not have experts or specialized departments, so we can't handle everything. However, they ignore the fact that there are a lot of approaches to solve this problem. First, when encountering new problems we can search the internet for professional solutions. Second, if we are not familiar with one field, we can try to consult experts in our family or around us for help. Consequently,  I am more willing to rely on my own and family than the government.

In conclusion, seeking family for help or relying on our own is better than counting on the government with respect to efficiency and ... , though the government is more professional in some field.





In addition, the other two methods are less ideal to our health to learn new things. For one thing, cooking food which we seldom ate may lead to food allergy. For example, I never tried to eat crab before, and one day some of my friend told me to try. It truly tasted good, but I eat too much. After that, I stayed on bed for two days because of crab allergy. Therefore, cooking food we do not normally eat may make the body uncomfortable. For another, it will put weight if we choose crafts like knitting. Because when we are crafting something, we sometimes sit on the chair for whole day. Therefore, it can easily lead to obesity. I still remember that my grandmother used to knit a lot. She liked knitting very much, but she soon found out that her weight is increasing rapidly, because she always busied in knitting. Thus, crafts like knitting will put our weight. As a consequence, there are clearly limitations concerning the other two choices of learning new things.

In the lecture, the professor is skeptical about the idea of the reading passage that setting up a  permanent station on Venus is impossible. The professor, however, argues that  although setting up a permanent station on Venus may not be without challenges, it is certainly possible.

First in the reading passage, it is pointed out that with a high pressure, everything made by humans can be destroyed easily. On the contrary, the professor maintains that though the pressure on the surface is pretty high, by setting up the basement high up in the atmosphere, the pressure can be much lower than the surface. The place where is 50 kilometers up in the atmosphere, the pressure can even be equal to the normal pressure we're used to here on Earth. Therefore, there would be no danger of the station getting crushed.

Nowadays, an increasingly large number of  young people are able to go to college and get higher education. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that colleges should not require freshman to take a class on how to study in college because they think it is useless. However, from my standpoint, it is essential to take a class on how to study in college with the following reasons.



There is no debate that delivering a class to the freshman on how to study in college is able to improve their study efficiency. That is to say, with a proper learning method, the students can learn new things quicker and faster. Take myself an an example. I still remember when I was new at college, the study pressue was heavy and most of our students in school felt stressful. At that time, the school held several study lectures for us. At the study meeting, the school invited many teachers and outstanding student representatives to share learning experiences and methods, which benefited us a lot. After mastering the correct learning methods, we could obviously feel that the learning pressure is greatly reduced, and more and more people were gradually adapting to the new learning life. Therefore, offering a study method class to the freshman in college is helpful to improve their study efficiency.

Tips: feel pressure(why?)

There are good reasons to suggesting that offering a study method class to the freshman in college allows them to make more friends. To be more specific, during the class, they share the new ideas with each other and have more opportunity to meet with new people. My friend Jacky is a good case in point. In fact, the first time we met was at a study meeting. In order to learn and progress together, we set up a study group. In the group, we exchanged opinions and discussed academic issues together. We often completed academic projects together. In this progress, we got to know each other better and better. Since then, he and I have become good friends. Accordingly, offering a study method class is beneficial to make more friends.







In the lecture, the professor is skeptical about the idea in the reading passage that the yellow cedar decline may be caused by insect parasites, brown bears and changes of climate. The professor, however, argues that they are not the fundamental cause responsible for the decline.



First in the reading passage, it is pointed out that the cedar bark beetle is to be blamed. One the contrary, the professor maintains that the cedar bark beetles is not the key point. According to the research, the yellow cedars are more resistant to insect infestation than other tree species. For example, the bark and leaves of yellow cadar are saturated with powerful chemicals that are poisonous to insects.To be more specific, healthy cedars are unlikely to suffer from insect damage. The trees that were already damaged or sick and would have probably died  under the attack of beetles. Therefore the decline of the yellow cedars is not attributed to the beetles.

Second, the professor then challenges the reading’s idea that brown bears should be responsible for the decline. She suggests that although bears damage some trees, they’re not the cause of the overall population decline. She uses an example to fight back. In the northwestern coast of North America, the yellow cedar populations both on the mainland and on islands have been declining. However, although there are no bears on the islands, the island cedars are still in decline. Thus, the bears cannot be responsible.

In the lecture, the professor is skeptical about the idea of the reading passage that ethanol is not a good replacement for gasoline. The professor, however, argues that ethanol is actually a good alternative.

First in the reading passage, it is pointed out that using ethanol cannot solve problem of global warming. On the contrary, the professor maintains that the increasing use of ethanol fuel will not add to global warming. Although it truly releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, the plant grown absorbs carbon dioxide from the air as part of its nutrition. So, to some extent, growing plants for ethanol production actually removes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Therefore, adopting the idea that choosing ethanol as a substitute is helpful to reducing the global warming.

Second, the professor then challenges the reading’s idea that the production of significant amounts of ethanol would dramatically reduce the number of plants available for uses other than fuel. He suggests that large-scale production of ethanol doesn't have to reduce the sources of food for animals. To be more specific, by using cellulose, which is the main component of plant cell walls and normally not eaten by animals, to produce ethanol, can make sure the amount of food available for animal will not be reduced. Thus, production of ethanol would not influence the food supply for animals.

Finally, the professor addresses that in the future, ethanol will be able to compete with gasoline in terms of price. Once enough people start buying ethanol, its producers will increase their production of ethanol which will lead to a drop in its price. A case in point is that studies already show that if ethanol production could be three times greater than it is now, the cost of producing a unit of ethanol would drop by forty percent. Accordingly, the price will not be a weakness of ethanol in the future. However, according to the reading passage, ethanol fuel will never be able to compete with gasoline on price.







Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that it is more significant to have specific knowledge in a field than having a good adaptation to new situations because they think specializing in one direction is easier to succeed. However, from my standpoint, I prefer that holding an excellent adaptability is much more essential with the following reasons.

First and foremost, there are good reasons suggesting that having the ability to adapt to changing situations may help us make more friends. To be more specific, compared to having specific knowledge in a field, we have more chance to meet more friends with a good adaptability. However, if we just always stay in our own field, we can only socialize with very limited amount of people. Take my professor Jacky as an example. His scientific research path had been constantly changing directions, because he wanted to develop in an all-round way and leave his name in many fields. Because of this, new scholars were constantly appearing around him, and he worked with them to achieve a lot of great progress. At the same time, the relationship between them was getting better and better. His social circle expanded rapidly. However, this was not the case with Robben, who was one of his classmates. He had always stayed in a specific field and never interacted with outsiders. Over time, his social circle had become very narrow. Thus, with a good adaptability may offer us with more opportunity to make friends.



Your university is now planning to add some new facilities to your dormitories. Which of the following three choices do you think they should add?

Gym

Study room

Play space(like watching a movie)

Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that the university should add some study room and play space to dormitories because they think the study room offer student a convenient place for studying and the play space provides them with a place to release their pressure. However, from my point of view, I prefer to set a gym in the dormitories with the following reasons.

First and foremost, there are good reasons suggesting that gym is able to help student keep fit. To be more specific, with a gym, students can take sports whenever they want which allows them to be healthy. For example, my middle school designed a gym in the dormitories. Every day after school, all of us liked to release our energy in it. During fitness, we not only get physical and mental relaxation, but also strengthen our body. After setting up the gym, the probability of students getting sick is greatly reduced. Therefore, gym is necessary for dormitories since it could keep student healthy.

In addition, the other two choice are less ideal. For one thing, setting a study room in dormitories is superfluous, since if students want to have a better place to study, they could choose to go to library. In the library, no one will annoy them and have plenty of books for them to reference. Moreover, students are tired enough after a busy day. The dormitories are designed for them to take rest. Therefore, it is unnecessary to set a study room in dormitories. For another, build a play space in dormitories may affect other students' rest. Take watching movies in dormitories as an example. If we watch films in the dormitory building, it undoubtedly will generate a lot of noise. For students want to have a sleep, it will be a catastrophe. Thus, allowing a play space in dormitories may have an influence on other students' rest. As a consequence, there are clearly limitations concerning the other two choices.
