Do you agree or disagree with the following statement: students these days are more interested in politics than before?



Nowadays, politics are becoming increasingly important in our daily life. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that students these days do not care about politics as before because people think politics are boring for youngs. However, from my stand point, students today are more interested in politics with the following reasons.



There is no debate that nowadays, students have more ways to get politic news. That is to say, with more opportunities to get politic news, students are more likely enjoy politics.  Take my father and I as an example, my father still remember when he was young, there are only few ways to receive news. At that time, most familiy do not have televisions or radios. For my dad, the only way is to get news from newspaper. However, in the 21 century, we now have the internet, young people now can easily get the politics news through the internet. Not only the news of their country, but also the politic news from other countries. I enjoy reading politic news because it is easily to get, just open an APP on my phone, then I get everything I want. Therefore, tudents have more ways to get politic news.



There are good reasons to suggesting that students today have more free time than before. To be more specific, with more time to spend on politics, students have more chance to  enjoy the politics. My grandpa is a good case in point. When he was young, he said he had to work long time in the field and had no time to rest. After finishing the job in field, he just wanted to eat something and get a good sleep. No one cares about politics, everyone are busy working for life. To the opposite, students nowadays, like me, we do not have to concern about our daily life. The only thing we have to do is study, our pressure is much lower than our olders. We can spend our time on what we like, for example, politics. Accordingly, students today have more free time than before.



Admittedly, some people may argue that although students today have more spare time, they may use it on entertainment. However, they ignore the fact that there are a lot of approaches to solve this problem. First, the school should enhance students’ awareness of political participation. Second, it is good idea to makes political news more in line with students’ appetites. Therefore, tudents today have more spare time for enjoying politics.



To sum up, students today are more interested in politics than before with respect to more ways to get news and more free time although they may spend the spare time on entertainment.
