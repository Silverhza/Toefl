It's much easier for parents to raise children now than 50 years ago. Do you agree or disagree with this statement?

------

In modern society, children increasingly become the core of a family. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that it is much easier for parents to raise children now than 50 years ago because economic conditions become better and the science and technology is getting more and more developed. However, from my point of view, to raise a child today is not easier than before with the following reasons.

First and foremost, there are good reasons to suggest that raising children today takes more time. That is to say, parents in 50 years ago do not need to spend a lot of time on their children, however, todays parents have to accompany their child for a long time. They tend to spend a lot of time with their children to grow up. For example, when I was young, my parents would often go out with me, cook and wash for me. However, my parents told me that when they were young, they did not have their parents accompany. Because in those days, parents did not attach much importance to the education of their children, nor did they spoil their children as much as parents do today. Therefore, it takes more time for parents to raise children today compares to 50 years before.

Secondly, there is no debate that raising children today cost more money. To be more specific, compared to 50 years before, parents now need to spend more money on children because in today’s society, with the improvement of parenting concepts, sometimes parents have to spend a lot of money to help their children grow up better. Take my uncle Johnson as an example, he gave birth to a child the year before, and in these two years, he spent a lot of money in order for his child to get better resources. In order to give his children a better access to educational resources, he spent a lot of money to buy the school district housing of a prestigious school. In order for the child to enter the kindergarten smoothly, he spent money to apply for the transition class for the child. If it was 50 years ago, no family would have done this, and the annual expenses on the children would usually be the food and clothes, nothing else. Accordingly, raising children today takes more money than 50 years before.

Admittedly, some people may argue that with today's medical technology, children are not easy to get sick. However, they ignore the fact that children in 50 years ago have stronger resistance to disease. On the other hand, children nowadays often suffer from lack of exercise and low resistance due to excessive parental pampering. In addition, viruses in 50 years ago were not as rampant as they are today. Most of the diseases that plague humans now are caused by environment pollution in recent years, such as the coronavirus, etc. These viruses did not exist 50 years ago. Consequently, children live in 50 years ago were not so easy to get sick.

In conclusion, to raise a child today is not that easier than 50 years before with the respect to requiring more time and money costing though the medical technology today is much more developed.
