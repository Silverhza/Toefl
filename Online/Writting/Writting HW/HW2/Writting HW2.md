Nowadays, the popularity of digital devices is getting higher and higher and the updates of the products are quite fast comparing to the past few years. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that when new electronic products released, we should buy them right away. From my standpoint, I prefer to wait with the following reasons.

There is much evidence that waiting till others have adopted these devices can offer you a better experience. To be more specific, when a product is first released, it has not been tested enough. Thus, it is always along with many bugs. The engineers sometimes need a couple of months to get everything fixed. We might take iPhone as an example, when iPhone 8 was released, the buyer found that the signal of the new product is awful, and this problem took Apple's engineers two months to fix. Accordingly, we can get better experience if we buy the product later.

It is significantly important to point out that waiting can also save money. That is to say, most of the time, the price of a new product is high, but in the near future, the price will drop significantly. At this time, the purchase is very affordable. For example, if you want to buy the latest Xiao MI, it will cost you a lot. However, after two months or so, the price will drop 500RMB, sometimes even 1000RMB. In other words, buying digital products later truly save your money.

In conclusion, avoiding buying digital products right away is beneficial with respect to convenience and saving money. 



# Q2:

In the past two decades, more and more children have the opportunity to be educated. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that it is difficult for a teacher to be both effective in teaching and liked by student. As far as I am concerned, it is not that hard with the following reasons.

We might easily find that a teacher with a effective teaching method can help students learn knowledge fast, in other words, they can save children's time. That is to say, children could have more spare time to do what they really want to do. Undoubtedly, this type of teachers will be welcomed by children. For example, when I was in middle school, our math teacher always uses the class time efficiently, so he never procrastinates. Students can use the time after class to take a good rest or do what they want. Thus, he is popular in our class. Therefore, being both effective in teaching and liked by student is not that hard.

There are good reasons to suggest that teacher who teaching effectively is able to broaden children's horizon. To be more specific, an efficient teacher could teach students more knowledge. For most students, they are eager for new knowledge. They like teacher who could teach them more. We might take my primary school teacher John as an example. John is the kind of teacher who with effective teaching method. In his class, we can learn more knowledge than other teachers'. Comparing with the knowledge in the textbook, the knowledge he told is more novel and vivid. That is why he is quite popular among us. Undeniably, it shows that it is not difficult for a teacher to be both effective and welcomed.

To sum up, being both effective and welcomed is not hard for a teacher with respect to saving childrenâ€™s time and expansion of knowledge horizon.
