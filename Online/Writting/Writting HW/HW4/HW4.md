# Q1:

Which of the following three things can help you improve your productivity the most?
A quiet environment in which you are not interrupted
Good salary
Interest

------

There are lots of way to increase our efficiency. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that good salary and a quiet environment could improve our productivity most because they think good salary is able to inspire people's working enthusiasm and a quiet environment can allow us to be more concentrated on our work. However, from my standpoint, I think interest is the thing which can increase the productivity most with the following reasons.

First and foremost, there is much evidence that interest is able to develop our skills. To be more specific, if we have a strong interest in something, we are willing to continuously find new solutions of the problems during the work, so our skills will be improved day by day. For example, I used to like playing Ping-Pong very much. When I was practicing, I always wanted to find new ways to play, like trying a new way of serving the ball. Because of my interest on this sport, I learned a large amount of Ping-Pong skills. It made me become a master hand. Therefore, interest is able to develop our skills.

In addition, the other two methods are less ideal to improve your productivity. For one thing, although good salary is able to inspire people's working enthusiasm, this kind of passion will not last for long. If you are working on something you are not interested at all, finally you will feel bored. After that you could not keep the high productivity anymore. Therefore, a good salary will not keep a long-lasting working enthusiasm. For another, it is the truth that a quiet environment can help you be more concentrated. However, high concentration does not mean high efficiency. Sometimes you may choose the wrong direction. For someone who has no passion for something, they may lack their own understanding of the work, so they often choose the wrong solution. Therefore, people may choose the wrong direction only depend on a quiet environment but without interest. As a consequence, there are clearly limitations concerning the other two choices of improving people's productivity.

In conclusion, interest is the thing which can increase the productivity most with respect to being able to develop our skills.



# Q2:

Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:
The best way for a teacher to make a student interested in a subject, is to explain that this subject will be useful outside the classroom.

------

When teaching students, it is hard for teachers to illustrate their interest. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that if teachers can explain that this subject will be useful outside the classroom, students may be more interested in the course. While from my perspective, this approach is not as helpful in cultivating childrenâ€™s interest and there are more efficient approaches.

First and foremost, sometimes our subject does not have an obvious application in our daily life. That is to say, we could not attract students' interest by telling them the usefulness of the subject in life. For example, considering the philosophy. In our daily life, if you are not a philosopher, you rarely use knowledge related to it. More usage scenarios of philosophical theory are more academic fields. We can easily find them in the book. Unfortunately, in our daily life, we seldom use them. Therefore, sometimes our subject does not have an obvious application in our daily life.

Secondly, we might easily find that doing more experiment of the subject is a better choice. For example, when studying psychology, a good approach to illustrate students' interest is to do experiment. With the experiment, students can fully understand the theory and be more enthusiastic to learn more. Our psychology teacher always took us to do experiments. That's the reason that his class was so popular and our all of us liked psychology so much. Thus, experiment is a better way to make students interested in a subject.

Thirdly, there is no debate that telling students some extracurricular knowledge us a better approach. To be more specific, sometime the knowledge in the textbook is boring and cannot satisfy students' curiosity. So, offering students with some knowledge which they cannot learn from book is able to illustrate their interest. Take my biology teacher as an example. During the class she always showed us some mysterious plants and animals which we had never seen before. For example, venus flytrap, lantern fish and so on. She even showed us some specimens, it was awesome. This made us interested in biology. Consequently, offering extracurricular knowledge is also a better approach to illustrate students' savor.

To sum up, we can safely come to the conclusion that explaining that the subject will be useful outside the classroom is not the best choice to make a student interested in a subject and there are additional ways for us to do so.
