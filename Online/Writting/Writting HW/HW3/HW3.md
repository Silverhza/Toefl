# Q1:

Do you agree or disagree？
Physical exercise is more important for older people than young people

------

Nowadays, more and more people know the importance of physical exercise. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that physical exercise is more important for older people than young people. However, from my standpoint, I disagree with this statement. In my opinion, physical exercise is more important for young people than old with the following reasons.

Firstly, there are good reasons to suggest that young people doing exercise can bring greater changes to health. To be more specific, since the old people’s body function has been degraded, physical exercise cannot bring much change to their naturally aging organs. However, to the young, their bodies have a strong ability to regenerate, they could get more benefits from physical exercise. For instance, three years ago, an English researcher's experiment shows that, compared to older people, the cells in young’s body after exercise will become more vigorous. Therefore, young people doing exercise can get more benefits than older.

Secondly, there is no debate that young people need more exercise, so it is important for them to get more physical training. That is to say, nowadays, young people always sit on their seat and working or studying for a whole day. They are lack of exercise actually. However, the older have enough time to do what they want, going to the supermarket, climbing the mountain and dancing the square dance. They have enough exercise in their daily life. Take my family as an example. My grandma enjoys going hiking, she often travels with other older people, she maintained good health by this kind of activity. However, my brother sits in his office and never goes out. Compared to my grandma, On the contrary, his health is not that good. The doctor has always telling him to work less and exercise more. Thus, young people need more exercise than older.

In conclusion, physical exercise is more vital for young people than older people with respect to young people need more exercise and they can get more benefits from it.



# Q2:

Suppose you have to work on a creative task. Do you prefer to work alone, or do you prefer to work with others?

------

Finding the right way of working is important to improve efficiency. Many people, if not most, are strong believers in the statement that working with others is better than working alone. However, from my standpoint, I prefer to working alone with the following reasons.

First and foremost, working alone there are good reasons to suggest that working alone is able to save more time than working with others. To be more specific, when working together, more people may lead to many conflicting opinions, this will slow down the work progress. However, working alone will not have this kind of problem. For example, my friend Bob worked in a big company. Two years ago, their company decided to update their product. Bob and his coworkers were told to get a new design. They gave many different proposals, everyone had their own opinions, but they did not get any unified opinions for a long time. It took them for three months to get a final design. However, Bob said if doing it by himself, it would not take that long time. Thus, working alone will not waste so many time than working with others.

Secondly, there is no debate that working alone can keep quality better than working together. That is to say, too many people working for a project sometimes cannot keep the quality good enough compared to working alone. We might take my experience as an example. Last semester, I worked with others to solve a team project. Although this project was very simple, the first edition program of our group was not very satisfactory. The main reason is that everyone thought that they were not the person in charge. However, after clarifying the scope of responsibility and everyone did their own scope alone, we got good results. Therefore, working alone leads to better quality than working together.

In conclusion, working alone is better than working with others with respect to more efficiency and better quality.
