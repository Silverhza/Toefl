Nowadays, people's work pressure is increasing day by day. To take a break from the busy life, more and more people take time to relax, enjoying hobbies and physical activities. Some of them prefer to do the same as their job, however, others hold the opinion that they should do something different from what they do at work. In my opinion, I prefer the later one. Here are my explanations.

Firstly, there is no debate that doing some activities unrelated to what we do at work, we can expend our knowledge. To be more specific, when doing something different to original work, we may able to gain new knowledge which we can not get from our work. 

Secondly, it is obvious that doing something irrelevant from work could help us to make more friends. That is to say, doing some activities distinguished to original work provide us with more opportunity to get in touch with people who are not familiar with in our work field and make friends with them.

Above all, doing something different from what you do at work is more advantageous than doing the same. It is able to broaden your horizon and offer you a real rest. Thus, in order to enjoy a truly rest, it is better to try some different activities.
