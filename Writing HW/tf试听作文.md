Nowadays, people's work pressure is increasing day by day. To take a break from the busy life, more and more people take time to relax, enjoying hobbies and physical activities. Some of them prefer to do the same as their job, however, others hold the opinion that they should do something different from what they do at work. In my opinion, I prefer the later one. Here are my explanations.

Firstly, by doing some different activities, we will gain an improvement in our horizon. Instead of doing some boring work over and over again, we are able to try something new, which is benefit for us. When enjoying this new activity, we learn new skills and take a rest.

Secondly, it is obvious that doing the same work is boring. Since we have be buried in our work for long, for a large majority of people, they are not willing to be annoyed by works again. The aim of relaxation is to escape from the work, so it is ridiculous to doing the same when you want to take time to relax.

Finally, despite the fact that most people are bored to do the same activity as their work, others may not. Some people may say they are willing to do the same. But think of that, we are trying to take a rest, so it is essential to get away from the same thing we are doing before. If we still focus on the similar things, our rest is meaningless.

Above all, doing something different from what you do at work is more advantageous than doing the same. It is able to broaden your horizon and offer you a real rest. Thus, in order to enjoy a truly rest, it is better to try some different activities.
