According to the professor, why is soap usually ineffective in salt water?
The sodium in soap cannot dissolve in water that has a high concentration of salt.
Sand particles in seawater can prevent soap from removing grease.
The presence of salt increases the temperature at which soap can remove grease.
Sodium reacts with soap to form substances incapable of removing grease.
