What does the professor imply when she mentions that there might have been a migration to Australia from India about four thousand years ago?
It is surprising that evidence for a migration cannot be found in the DNA record.
There is strong evidence in Australia to support the idea.
It is likely that a migration from Africa to Australia would not have passed through India.
Indian artifacts that might be from this time period cannot be dated with precision.
